  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical JavaScript code following Standard.js rules.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content.
  - Keep files under 200 lines; split into multiple components/files if exceeded.
  - Break down large components into smaller, focused sub-components.
  - Extract utility functions and custom hooks into separate files.
  - Use composition and higher-order patterns to reduce file complexity.

  Standard.js Rules
  - Use 2 space indentation.
  - Use single quotes for strings except to avoid escaping.
  - No semicolons (unless required to disambiguate statements).
  - No unused variables.
  - Add a space after keywords.
  - Add a space before a function declaration's parentheses.
  - Always use === instead of ==.
  - Infix operators must be spaced.
  - Commas should have a space after them.
  - Keep else statements on the same line as their curly braces.
  - For multi-line if statements, use curly braces.
  - Always handle the err function parameter.
  - Use camelcase for variables and functions.
  - Use PascalCase for constructors and React components.

  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.

  TypeScript Best Practices
  - Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json with strictNullChecks and noImplicitAny.
  - Use interfaces for object shapes and types for unions/primitives.
  - Prefer type assertions over type casting: use 'as Type' instead of '<Type>'.
  - Use utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, Record) for type transformations.
  - Define return types for functions explicitly, especially for public APIs.
  - Use generic types for reusable components and functions.
  - Leverage discriminated unions for complex state management.
  - Use const assertions for literal types: 'as const'.
  - Prefer unknown over any; use type guards for narrowing.
  - Use satisfies operator for better type inference while maintaining type safety.
  - Define prop types with interfaces extending HTML attributes when needed.
  - Use branded types for better type safety with primitive values.

  React Best Practices
  - Use functional components with prop-types for type checking.
  - Use the "function" keyword for component definitions.
  - Implement hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback).
  - Follow the Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at the top level, only call hooks from React functions).
  - Create custom hooks to extract reusable component logic.
  - Use React.memo() for component memoization when appropriate.
  - Implement useCallback for memoizing functions passed as props.
  - Use useMemo for expensive computations.
  - Avoid inline function definitions in render to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Prefer composition over inheritance.
  - Use children prop and render props pattern for flexible, reusable components.
  - Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting.
  - Use refs sparingly and mainly for DOM access.
  - Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components.
  - Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
  - Use cleanup functions in useEffect to prevent memory leaks.
  - Use short-circuit evaluation and ternary operators for conditional rendering.
  - Always provide keys for list items; avoid using index as key for dynamic lists.
  - Use React.Fragment or <> instead of unnecessary div wrappers.
  - Implement proper loading and error states for async operations.
  - Use useId for generating unique IDs in server-side rendering.
  - Leverage React.startTransition for non-urgent updates.
  - Use useDeferredValue for expensive operations that can be deferred.
  - Implement proper event handler patterns (avoid inline handlers in JSX).
  - Use portals for modals, tooltips, and overlays that need to escape normal flow.

  Next.js App Router Best Practices
  - Understand Server vs Client Components; default to Server Components.
  - Use async Server Components for data fetching instead of useEffect.
  - Implement proper loading.js, error.js, and not-found.js files.
  - Use route groups (parentheses) for organization without affecting URL structure.
  - Implement proper metadata API for SEO (generateMetadata function).
  - Use generateStaticParams for static generation with dynamic routes.
  - Leverage parallel routes and intercepting routes for advanced layouts.
  - Use Server Actions for form submissions and mutations.
  - Implement proper streaming with Suspense boundaries.
  - Use middleware.js for authentication, redirects, and request modification.
  - Optimize images with next/image and implement proper sizing.
  - Use next/font for font optimization and prevent layout shift.
  - Implement proper caching strategies (revalidate, cache, unstable_cache).
  - Use route handlers (app/api) for API endpoints with proper HTTP methods.
  - Implement proper error handling with error boundaries and error.js.
  - Use dynamic imports for code splitting client-side components.
  - Leverage ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for dynamic content.

  State Management
  - Use Zustand for global state management.
  - Lift state up when needed to share state between components.
  - Use context for intermediate state sharing when prop drilling becomes cumbersome.
  - Implement proper state normalization for complex data structures.
  - Use reducer pattern for complex state logic with useReducer.
  - Avoid over-optimization with state; keep related state together.
  - Use local state when possible before reaching for global state.

  UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI and Radix UI for component foundations.
  - This is the command to add ShadCN components: "npx shadcn@latest add button"

  - KEEP IN MIND TO ADD SHADCN COMPONENTS, the command is "npx shadcn@latest add", for example to add the button component its "npx shadcn@latest add button"
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  - Use Tailwind for utility classes and rapid prototyping.
  - Implement consistent spacing and sizing scales.
  - Use CSS custom properties for theme-able values.
  - Implement proper focus states and keyboard navigation.
  - Use CSS Grid and Flexbox appropriately for layouts.

  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'useState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Prefer Next.js Server actions for data fetching
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  - Implement route-based code splitting in Next.js.
  - Minimize the use of global styles; prefer modular, scoped styles.
  - Use PurgeCSS with Tailwind to remove unused styles in production.
  - Implement proper bundle analysis and monitoring.
  - Use React DevTools Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks.
  - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists.
  - Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks.
  - Implement proper prefetching strategies for navigation.

  Forms and Validation
  - Use controlled components for form inputs.
  - Implement form validation (client-side and server-side).
  - Consider using libraries like react-hook-form for complex forms.
  - Use Zod or Joi for schema validation.
  - Implement proper form submission with Server Actions.
  - Use proper ARIA labels and descriptions for form accessibility.
  - Implement debouncing for search inputs and expensive validations.

  Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions.
  - Use error boundaries to catch and handle React errors gracefully.
  - Implement global error handling with error.js files in App Router.
  - Use proper TypeScript error types instead of throwing strings.

  Accessibility (a11y)
  - Use semantic HTML elements.
  - Implement proper ARIA attributes.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation support.
  - Implement proper color contrast ratios.
  - Use proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.).
  - Implement focus management for modals and dynamic content.
  - Use proper alt text for images and meaningful link text.
  - Test with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation.

  Security
  - Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.

  - Use HTTPS everywhere and implement proper CSP headers.
  - Validate data on both client and server sides.
  - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration.

  Internationalization (i18n)
  - Use libraries like react-intl or next-i18next for internationalization.

  Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  - Implement proper data fetching patterns with React Query or SWR when needed.
  - Use proper file and folder organization (feature-based or atomic design).
  - Implement consistent naming conventions across the codebase.
